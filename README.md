# PyInterviews
Hi there! My name is Danny Vilela and I'm a sophomore at NYU studying computer science. I'm into data science and thought it might be cool to solve a bunch of problems that are normally in Java – I'm looking at you, Gayle – in Python. This is really just for me to brush up my Python skills, but feel free to check out my solutions (for reference, of course). I ask that you don't copy my solutions and instead – if you've noticed that I've solved a problem you've been assigned – try solving it on your own to the best of your abilities before looking at my solution. I promise, it's for your own good.

Here's the directory breakdown:

## Challenges
These are questions I've been asked as "screening" questions, usually over email and before any phone calls. I've done my best to
anonymize the actual companies that gave me these challenges. This directory may include problems from [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) or [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) of "moderate" difficulty and above.

## InterviewQ
These are questions I've been asked during interviews -- whether they're over the phone or onsite. Again, I've done what I can to
anonymize the actual companies involved.

## Books
This'll be a directory of books that I'll (eventually) read and (eventually) implement solutions to the practice problems therein (in Python).

Thanks!
