# PyInterviews
Hi there! My name is Danny Vilela and I'm a sophomore at NYU studying computer science. I'm into data science and thought it might be cool to solve a bunch of problems that are normally in Java – I'm looking at you, Gayle – in Python. This is really just for me to brush up my Python skills, but feel free to check out my solutions (for reference, of course). I ask that you don't copy my solutions and instead – if you've noticed that I've solved a problem you've been assigned – try solving it on your own to the best of your abilities before looking at my solution. I promise, it's for your own good.

That said, the shorter, cooler README is something like: "Reading books. Solving problems. Python."

Thanks!
